This is a write of the easy rated THM room Bounty Hacker

You were boasting on and on about your elite hacker skills in the bar and a few Bounty Hunters decided they'd take you up on claims! Prove your status is more than just a few glasses at the bar. I sense bell peppers & beef in your future!

It's a pretty fun intro to the CTF. Lets enjoy this game together.

So it's a hack so we're going to start with a classic nmap scan using my preferred scans.

nmap -sS -sV -vv -A 10.10.39.227

and we got (only pertinent info)

The interesting ports I see from the get go is ftp, ssh and http
	So I'm going to run gobuster scan to see whats on the website.

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.39.227 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Cool so this tells us nothing super useful at the moment so I'm going to take a look at the ftp port.

ftp -p 10.10.39.227 21
	As its ftp the username anonymous allows us to connect.

Annoyingly I was logged in in passive mode so just type in the command "passive" to turn it off
Then i get the files we can see in the ftp site. One is locks and the other is tasks. In the tasks file we can see the answer to the next question for the room.

Looking at locks.txt it seems a lot like a file of passwords. So It's time for ssh i think
	(And BTW the answer to the next question is in the above info)

So we have a username from the tasks file and a file that seems to be full of passwords. So with hydra we can brute force the credentials for ssh
	hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.39.227 -t 4 ssh

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2021-05-05 22:05:39
[DATA] max 4 tasks per 1 server, overall 4 tasks, 26 login tries (l:1/p:26), ~7 tries per task
[DATA] attacking ssh://10.10.39.227:22/
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.39.227   login: REDACTED   password: REDACTED
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) finished at 2021-05-05 22:05:48

We have the credentials now so we can ssh into the machine.
	And bing bang boom we're in.

The first flag is right there for us as we connect
	cat user.txt

Now we need to work on privledge escalation to get to the root flag

sudo -l shows us (sudo password is the same we used to ssh in)

Matching Defaults entries for lin on bountyhacker:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
    (root) /bin/***

So off to gtfo bins to see if /bin/*** can allow us to escalate to root

Now we can find the tar section of the gtfobins and run the command under the sudo header. That allows us to maintain root privledges.

With these privledges we can read the /root/root.txt flag

Hope you enjoyed this CTF as much as I did and have a good day.
